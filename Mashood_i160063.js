                <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
                And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
                And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
                And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

                <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
                And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
                Though as for that the passing there<br/>
                Had worn them really about the same,</p>

                <p>And both that morning equally lay<br/>
                In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
                I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

                <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br/>
                I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
                And that has made all the difference.</p>
